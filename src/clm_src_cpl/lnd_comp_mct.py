"""
JAX translation of lnd_comp_mct module.

This module provides the interface of the active land model component of CESM (CLM)
with the main CESM driver. It defines the public API for CLM initialization and
run phases, serving as the top-level interface between the land model and the
coupled system.

The module orchestrates the two-stage initialization process and provides the
main entry point for running the land model timestep.

    Initialize land surface model.
    
    This function performs the two-stage initialization of the Community Land
    Model (CLM). It sequentially calls initialize1 and initialize2 to set up
    the model state and configuration. This is the main entry point for CLM
    initialization from the CESM coupler.
    
    Stage 1 (initialize1): Sets up basic model structure, reads namelist,
                          initializes decomposition
    Stage 2 (initialize2): Initializes model state variables, reads initial
                          conditions or performs cold start
    
    Args:
        bounds: Domain decomposition bounds containing grid indices for the
               local processor (begp, endp, begc, endc, begg, endg, begl, endl).
    
    Returns:
        None. Initialization is performed through side effects in the called
        functions. In a full JAX implementation, this would return initialized
        state as immutable data structures.
    
    Note:
        This is a wrapper function that orchestrates the initialization sequence.
        The actual initialization logic is contained in initialize1 and initialize2
        from the clm_initializeMod module.
        
        In a pure JAX implementation, this function would need to be refactored
        to return state rather than modify it through side effects.

    Run CLM model for a single timestep.
    
    This is the main entry point for executing one timestep of the Community
    Land Model. It serves as a wrapper that calls the main CLM driver routine
    (clm_drv) which performs all the physics calculations for the timestep.

    - Surface energy balance
    - Hydrological processes

                  when calday = 1.0). Used for time-dependent forcing and
                  phenology calculations.
        fin: File name for input/output operations. Used for restart files
            and diagnostic output.

        This is a thin wrapper around clm_drv from the clm_driver module.
        In the original Fortran, this performs a subroutine call with implicit
        state modification. In JAX, the actual implementation would need to
        import and call the translated clm_drv function and handle state
        updates explicitly through return values.
        
        The function signature would need to be extended to accept and return
