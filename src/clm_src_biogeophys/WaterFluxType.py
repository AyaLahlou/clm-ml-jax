WaterFluxType module - Water flux variables for CTSM

Translated from Fortran source: WaterFluxType.F90, lines 1-63

This module defines water flux state variables and initialization routines
for the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM). It manages evaporation
and transpiration fluxes at the patch level.

Key components:
- WaterFluxType: NamedTuple holding water flux state variables
- init_waterflux_type: Initialize flux state with default values
- init: Main initialization routine
- init_allocate: Allocate and initialize flux arrays based on domain bounds
- update_qflx_evap_tot_patch: Functional update for evaporation flux

Fortran module dependencies:
- shr_kind_mod: Real kind parameter (r8)
- clm_varcon: Constants (ispval, spval/nan)
- decompMod: Domain decomposition bounds
