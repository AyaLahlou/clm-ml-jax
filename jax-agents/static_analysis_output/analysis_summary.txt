Recommendations:
  Translation Strategy:
    - Large project detected. Consider incremental translation approach.

  Dependency Issues:
    - Project depends on 9 external libraries. Verify availability in target language.

  Optimization Opportunities:
    - Modules ['decompMod', 'clm_varcon', 'clm_varpar'] are heavily used. Prioritize their translation.
